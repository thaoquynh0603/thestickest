# Database Security Configuration

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented for the TheStickest database.

## Row Level Security (RLS) Status
✅ **ENABLED** on all tables:
- `products`
- `templates` 
- `carousel_items`

## Current Policies

### Products Table
- **Public Read Access**: Only active products (`is_active = true`) are viewable
- **Write Access**: Blocked for anonymous users
- **Admin Access**: Reserved for authenticated admin users (future implementation)

### Templates Table
- **Public Read Access**: All templates are viewable (needed for theming)
- **Write Access**: Blocked for anonymous users
- **Admin Access**: Reserved for authenticated admin users (future implementation)

### Carousel Items Table
- **Public Read Access**: Only active carousel items (`is_active = true`) are viewable
- **Write Access**: Blocked for anonymous users
- **Admin Access**: Reserved for authenticated admin users (future implementation)

## Security Features

### 1. Data Access Control
- Anonymous users can only READ data
- All WRITE operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are blocked for public access
- Only active/inactive filtering prevents access to unpublished content

### 2. Function-Based Security
- Replaced `product_details` view with secure functions
- `get_product_details()` and `get_product_by_slug()` functions with SECURITY DEFINER
- Functions respect RLS policies from underlying tables
- No direct table access, only through controlled functions

### 3. Future Admin Access
- `is_admin()` function prepared for role-based access control
- Admin policies created but currently disabled
- Ready for authentication system integration

## Environment Variables
Required for secure database access:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://hyrjcmrvrxtepvlpmgxs.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-anon-key]
```

## Recommendations

### For Production
1. **Enable Authentication**: Implement user authentication for admin access
2. **API Rate Limiting**: Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. **Audit Logging**: Track all database access for security monitoring
4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular automated backups with encryption

### For Development
1. **Local Environment**: Use separate database for development
2. **Test Data**: Use mock data or separate test database
3. **Access Logs**: Monitor database access during development

## Current Status
- ✅ RLS Enabled on all tables
- ✅ Public Read Access Configured
- ✅ Write Access Blocked
- ✅ Function-Based Security Implemented
- ✅ No Direct Table Access
- ⏳ Admin Authentication (Future)
- ⏳ Audit Logging (Future)

## Function-Based Security Details

The data access is now secured through:
1. **Secure Functions**: `get_product_details()` and `get_product_by_slug()` with SECURITY DEFINER
2. **RLS Respect**: Functions automatically respect RLS policies from underlying tables
3. **Controlled Access**: No direct table access, only through controlled functions
4. **Data Filtering**: Only active products and carousel items are returned
